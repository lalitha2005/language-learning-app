# Language Learning App

### Overview
This Language Learning App was inspired by the challenges faced when trying to pick up conversational responses as a non-native English speaker. The application listens to conversations in English and generates automated responses in text or voice. It explains why each response is appropriate, covering various conversational norms and grammar rules, helping users to learn English more effectively and naturally.

### Features
- **Real-Time Speech Recognition**: Listens to spoken English input, transcribes it, and generates appropriate responses.
- **Conversational Guidance**: Provides suggested replies to common conversational cues with explanations of grammar and contextual relevance.
- **Grammar and Rule Explanation**: Each generated response comes with an explanation, allowing users to learn real-time conversational patterns and correct their mistakes.
- **Interactive Practice**: Encourages learning by doing, as users can repeat conversations and see different response options.

### Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core language for development
- **SpeechRecognition**: Speech-to-text conversion
- **PyAudio**: Captures real-time audio input from the microphone
- **Google Speech Recognition API**: Transcribes audio to text for response generation

## Project Setup

### Step 1: Set Up Your Project Environment
1. **Install Python**  
   Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org). Verify the installation by running:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

2. **Create a Project Folder**  
   Create a directory for the project, e.g., `LanguageLearningApp`.

3. **Open in Code Editor**  
   Open the project folder in a code editor like Visual Studio Code or PyCharm.

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment
1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **Windows**:  
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **Mac/Linux**:  
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

### Step 3: Install Required Libraries
1. Install `SpeechRecognition` and `PyAudio`:
   ```bash
   pip install SpeechRecognition pyaudio
   ```

   **Note**: For Windows, you may need to download the PyAudio `.whl` file and install it manually.

### Step 4: Write the Code
1. Create a new Python file named `language_app.py` and add the following code:

   ```python
   import speech_recognition as sr

   # Function to capture audio and convert it to text
   def get_audio_input():
       recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
       with sr.Microphone() as source:
           print("Say something in English!")
           audio = recognizer.listen(source)
       try:
           text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
           print(f"Transcribed Text: {text}")
           return text
       except sr.UnknownValueError:
           print("Sorry, I couldn't understand the audio.")
           return None
       except sr.RequestError:
           print("Could not request results; check your internet connection.")
           return None

   # Simple response generation function based on input text
   def generate_response(user_input):
       if "hello" in user_input.lower():
           return "Hello! How can I help you with English?"
       elif "help" in user_input.lower():
           return "I'm here to help you practice your responses!"
       else:
           return "That's interesting! Let's keep the conversation going."

   # Main function to run the app
   def main():
       user_text = get_audio_input()
       if user_text:
           response = generate_response(user_text)
           print(f"AI Response: {response}")

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()
   ```

2. This code captures audio input, transcribes it to text, and generates a response.

### Step 5: Run the Code
1. Make sure your virtual environment is active, then run the code:
   ```bash
   python language_app.py
   ```
2. Speak into your microphone when prompted. The app will transcribe and respond in real time.

### Future Improvements
- Integrate support for additional languages.
- Improve response generation with natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
- Add more complex grammar explanations and alternative response options.
